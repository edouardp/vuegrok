You don't have to use a local version of Vue in a project directory
in order to use Vue - you can simply source it from a CDN and
use it that way.

Simply run by firing up a static web server, for example with
>python -m SimpleHTTPServer
and browse to localhost:8000 (or whatever the default port of
you web browser is)
